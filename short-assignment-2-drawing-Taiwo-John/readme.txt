Hello Mehdi

I acknowledge that I have upheld the honor code.

I also added a clear function to reset the window for a new drawing :)

I got a way around setting limits for my brush size without using the min/max function.
I just had to wrap it in the control statements in the determine_brush_sie function.

Cheers!
Taiwo.
